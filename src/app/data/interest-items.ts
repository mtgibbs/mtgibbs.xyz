                      feel the rush of accomplishment when they have finally executed or arrived at the solution.  All of this with a framework of defined rulesets and \
                      a tight feedback loop.  It\'s not really a surprise that someone with an interest in software would also have an interest in games.',

                      and bad ideas or techniques are cast out; all to reach a better and stronger result.'
