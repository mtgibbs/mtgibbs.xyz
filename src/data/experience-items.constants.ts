                      to integration between all of the scanning technologies that Fortify offers.  Within Fortify, I champion code reuse across our various teams to help grow our inner-source initiative through shareable \

                      With this new system we were able to implement a variety of systems and features.  From fraud detection and prevention to an easy interface for the user to modify and update records \

        subTitle: 'Aflac',
        description: 'I developed and maintained a legacy high-volume automated policy processing suite interfacing with DB2 Databases, IBM ASM, and COBOL via JNI and CICS.  All new development was written in Java running in IBM WebSphere, \
                      leveraging existing and stable ASM modules where it was possible.  I was involved in several projects to increase straight-through processing to decrease work on the customer and to increase  \
                      system agility for new product time-to-market. This role is special for having exposed me large and complicated legacy systems when I was just cutting my teeth as a new developer.  \
                      So often we find that when we automate without the willingness to adapt our business practices.  And when that happens, the system will virtually represent the physical scheme that we were \
                      trying to automate.  Learning to adapt one\'s thinking to sell an idea on how to make something more maintainable after it has worked "just fine" for the last seven years \
                      is something that every engineer or developer needs to go through.  There lies in the depths of these programs the absolute core of a company\'s history, mistakes, and successes. \
                      And most of that history has likely been forgotten or taken for granted.',
